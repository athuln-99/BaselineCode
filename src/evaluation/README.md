# Evaluation code

This code is for evaluation of the model results. It is the same code used to evaluate submissions in CodaLab.

## Usage:

```
python evaluate.py <input_dir> <output_dir>
```

input_dir: folder that contains two subfolders with data, 'ref' for reference data and 'res' for predictions.

output_dir: folder where the output file 'scores.txt' is going to be stored.
